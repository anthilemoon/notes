A note that isn't linked to any other notes.

## Is it OK to have orphan notes?

Some people prefer not to - e.g. [Do not keep orphan notes](https://www.mentalnodes.com/do-not-keep-orphan-notes).
Maybe you have an orphan note for a short period - but eventually you do tidy it up as part of your regular [[wiki gardening]].
