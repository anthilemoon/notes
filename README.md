## What are these notes?

We want to keep a long-lived record of our community's ideas and links (as opposed to them disappearing into timeline history), and keep an up-to-date map of tools and ideas.

These notes are not comprehensive, and are intended to be an introduction and a starting point - for more discussion and detail, on each note we keep a 'Twin Pages' section that links out to other digital gardens with more thoughts from individual gardeners.

We're keeping the notes in [[Markdown]], which is a simple, open format that can be edited in various tools for thought such as [[Obsidian]], [[Foam]], etc - or simply with just a plain-text editor.
